Have you ever felt so frustrated and confused at the task of trying to digest new information that your head physically began to ache?

You are not alone! And better yet, you are one the right track!!

Learning new information and creating the corresponding neural pathways can be likened surprisingly well to physical exercise.  No one steps into the gym for the first time, does a set of bench press, and leaves looking like Arnold.

In a similar fashion, you cannot expect to learn everything there is to know about a complex subject by simply running through the information a few times.

Both acquiring knowledge and strength training are intense and painful processes, and only return impressive results when consistently applied over a long-term basis.

In the world today, society has created an expectation for immediate results.  High speed internet connections, smart phones and decreased attention spans have all contributed to this paradigm of immediate gratification.

Learning abstractly is an amazing capability that humans alone possess.  It is so intricate and complex that we have not yet been able to even replicate it artificially.

My point is this:  have patience.  Learning is supposed to be hard.  That's what makes us so special as a species.  Acquiring knowledge and coating neurons with myelin is not a linear process.  You will not always 'feel' like you are learning.  

The feeling of being overwhelmed by informational input is analogous to progressive overload in strength training.  Your muscles will not adapt and grow larger without sufficient stimulus.  Similarly, your brain will not become faster and more flexible without the same!

The next time your head begins to hurt during an uptake of new and complex material, remember that is the feeling of progress!  The confusion will be temporary; all you need to focus on is having an open mind and being patient.

It is ok the be confused!
